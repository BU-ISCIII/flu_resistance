The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

Residue E119 is\ninvolved in the interaction between the enzyme NA and the guanidine group (zanamivir, laninamivir and peramivir) or the C4 hydroxyl group (oseltamivir).

A change to glycine (G) or alanine (A) or even valine (V) (nonpolar side chain) can remove both interactions, thus\nfurther destabilizing the inhibitor binding. If there is a E119G mutation, there will be a replacement of a larger group with a smaller glycine group (removal of carboxymethyl group),\nwhich causes the removal of the interactions between residue 119 and oseltamivir.

It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

Therefore, H274 mutation does not cause zanamivir resistance\nand is generally unaffected by conformational changes conferred by H274Y.

The hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of\nthe trihydroxypropyl tail of zanamivir and E277 carboxyl group in WT were replaced with hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring E276 carboxyl in the mutant, as inferred from the\ndistance distributions for the oxygen atoms.

R224 is important in the formation of a salt link\nto E276, that is involved in the formation of the hydrophobic pocket for oseltamivir binding. If a mutation occurs at I222, this would lead to the loss of interactions between the side\nchain of I222 and the pentyl ether group of oseltamivir. Therefore, there will be a greater impact on the binding of oseltamivir than of zanamivir. The side chain of the I222L mutant\nprotrudes into the hydrophobic pocket of the active site, that accommodates the pentyloxy substituent of oseltamivir. This causes a change in the conformation of the inhibitor.\nHowever, the linkage with sialic acids is not impared, because its glycerol group is more distant from the residue in position 222. Normally, isoleucine is able to orient itself so that the\nshorter branch of its side chain is able to pack against the pentylester group of oseltamivir. Leucine has a uniform length, but it may disrupt the optimal position of oseltamivir in this\nhydrophobic pocket, in an analogous manner observed with H274Y. Consistent with lower levels of inhibition to zanamivir, this mutant doesn\u2019t show marked changes in the\nconformation of zanamivir.

Residue E119 is\ninvolved in the interaction between the enzyme NA and the guanidine group (zanamivir, laninamivir and peramivir) or the C4 hydroxyl group (oseltamivir). If glutamic acid (E) would be\nreplaced by amino acids with a shorter chain, such as aspartic acid (D) or glycine (G), these interactions could be significantly altered. Other substitutions of residue 119 may result in\naltered binding processes and NAI resistance in influenza A and B. A change to glycine (G) or alanine (A) or even valine (V) (nonpolar side chain) can remove both interactions, thus\nfurther destabilizing the inhibitor binding.

R224 is important in the formation of a salt link\nto E276, that is involved in the formation of the hydrophobic pocket for oseltamivir binding. If a mutation occurs at I222, this would lead to the loss of interactions between the side\nchain of I222 and the pentyl ether group of oseltamivir. Therefore, there will be a greater impact on the binding of oseltamivir than of zanamivir. The side chain of the I222L mutant\nprotrudes into the hydrophobic pocket of the active site, that accommodates the pentyloxy substituent of oseltamivir. This causes a change in the conformation of the inhibitor.\nHowever, the linkage with sialic acids is not impared, because its glycerol group is more distant from the residue in position 222. Normally, isoleucine is able to orient itself so that the\nshorter branch of its side chain is able to pack against the pentylester group of oseltamivir. Leucine has a uniform length, but it may disrupt the optimal position of oseltamivir in this\nhydrophobic pocket, in an analogous manner observed with H274Y. Consistent with lower levels of inhibition to zanamivir, this mutant doesn\u2019t show marked changes in the\nconformation of zanamivir.

The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

Therefore, H274 mutation does not cause zanamivir resistance\nand is generally unaffected by conformational changes conferred by H274Y.

The hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of\nthe trihydroxypropyl tail of zanamivir and E277 carboxyl group in WT were replaced with hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring E276 carboxyl in the mutant, as inferred from the\ndistance distributions for the oxygen atoms.

The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

The mutation allows the binding of natural sialic acid substrate, so mutated virus can survive and propagate. Therefore, H274 mutation does not cause zanamivir resistance\nand is generally unaffected by conformational changes conferred by H274Y. The E276-R292 interaction is strengthened by the mutation, however this change occurred concurrently with\na weakening of the E277-R292 interaction and changes in hydrogen bonding between the zanamivir tail and R118, E276 and E277. The hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of\nthe trihydroxypropyl tail of zanamivir and E277 carboxyl group in WT were replaced with hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring E276 carboxyl in the mutant, as inferred from the\ndistance distributions for the oxygen atoms. The structure of the H274Y mutant and zanamivir showed a small shift in the side chain of E276, enabling the interaction between the\ninhibitor and E276 without the disruption observed in the sialic acid complexed with wild type NA.

The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

The mutation allows the binding of natural sialic acid substrate, so mutated virus can survive and propagate. Therefore, H274 mutation does not cause zanamivir resistance\nand is generally unaffected by conformational changes conferred by H274Y. The E276-R292 interaction is strengthened by the mutation, however this change occurred concurrently with\na weakening of the E277-R292 interaction and changes in hydrogen bonding between the zanamivir tail and R118, E276 and E277. The hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of\nthe trihydroxypropyl tail of zanamivir and E277 carboxyl group in WT were replaced with hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring E276 carboxyl in the mutant, as inferred from the\ndistance distributions for the oxygen atoms. The structure of the H274Y mutant and zanamivir showed a small shift in the side chain of E276, enabling the interaction between the\ninhibitor and E276 without the disruption observed in the sialic acid complexed with wild type NA.

        "mechanism": "I222L: The I222 residue is located near the N-acetyl and glycerol side chains of zanamivir, the pentyl ether group of oseltamivir and R224. R224 is important in the formation of a salt link\nto E276, that is involved in the formation of the hydrophobic pocket for oseltamivir binding. If a mutation occurs at I222, this would lead to the loss of interactions between the side\nchain of I222 and the pentyl ether group of oseltamivir. Therefore, there will be a greater impact on the binding of oseltamivir than of zanamivir. The side chain of the I222L mutant\nprotrudes into the hydrophobic pocket of the active site, that accommodates the pentyloxy substituent of oseltamivir. This causes a change in the conformation of the inhibitor.\nHowever, the linkage with sialic acids is not impared, because its glycerol group is more distant from the residue in position 222. Normally, isoleucine is able to orient itself so that the\nshorter branch of its side chain is able to pack against the pentylester group of oseltamivir. Leucine has a uniform length, but it may disrupt the optimal position of oseltamivir in this\nhydrophobic pocket, in an analogous manner observed with H274Y. Consistent with lower levels of inhibition to zanamivir, this mutant doesn\u2019t show marked changes in the\nconformation of zanamivir. (67, 156, 215)\nE119V: The glutamic acid at position 119 is highly conserved and is known to stabilize the NA catalytic site and therefore enhances the cleavage of sialic acid residues. Residue E119 is\ninvolved in the interaction between the enzyme NA and the guanidine group (zanamivir, laninamivir and peramivir) or the C4 hydroxyl group (oseltamivir). If glutamic acid (E) would be\nreplaced by amino acids with a shorter chain, such as aspartic acid (D) or glycine (G), these interactions could be significantly altered. Other substitutions of residue 119 may result in\naltered binding processes and NAI resistance in influenza A and B. A change to glycine (G) or alanine (A) or even valine (V) (nonpolar side chain) can remove both interactions, thus\nfurther destabilizing the inhibitor binding. E119 residue only plays a minor role in the binding of oseltamivir carboxylate to NA, because its location within the pocket 3 region, due to a\nsmall amino group in oseltamivir. The NA with E119V may accommodate a water molecule, which would interfere with the binding of oseltamivir to the active site.

The resistant phenotype to oseltamivir and\nzanamivir seems to rely on residue A246. So, conformational changes at the surface due to a deletion from 245-248 (4 aa deletion: S245, A246, S247 and G248) could disturb the\nhydrophobic acid pocket. This pocket contains the glycerol side chain of sialic acid and NAI, it may potentially alter the NAI binding. (10, 69)\nQ136K: The side chain of Q136 is involved in a hydrogen bonding network, where it interacts with the side chain of R156 that in turn interacts with the backbone of D151. D151 forms 2\nhydrogen bonds with the guanidine moiety of zanamivir. R156 also interacts directly with zanamivir via van der Waals interactions. Group 1 NA (N1, N4, N5 and N8) has a 150-loop\n(residue 147-152) conformation, that opens up a cavity adjacent to the active site, the 150-cavity, which is not present in group 2 NA. The size of the 150-cavity is determined by the\ninteraction of the residue 136 and the 150-loop. The Q136K mutation can break down the hydrogen bonding network, possibly leading to increased mobility of the R156 and D151\nresidues, which disturbed the interactions between these residues and zanamivir, which leads to an increase in resistance. The cause of zanamivir drug resistance due to Q136K can be\nascribed to the fact that the mutated K136 deforms the 150 loop, which then weakens the interaction between zanamivir and the active site residues. Peramivir will also be affected by\nthe mutation, since it has the same guanidine moiety as zanamivir. Q136K introduces repulsive charges to the guanidine group of both zanamivir and peramivir. In contrast, oseltamivir\ndoes not form interactions with R156 or the D151 backbone and are unaffected by the mutation, because it lacks a functional group approaching lysine at position 136. Q136K mutants\nremain susceptible to oseltamivir, so the interactions between the D151 side chain and oseltamivir are probably maintained. (10, 69, 94, 113, 114, 223, 243)\nE119V: The glutamic acid at position 119 is highly conserved and is known to stabilize the NA catalytic site and therefore enhances the cleavage of sialic acid residues. Residue E119 is\ninvolved in the interaction between the enzyme NA and the guanidine group (zanamivir, laninamivir and peramivir) or the C4 hydroxyl group (oseltamivir). If glutamic acid (E) would be\nreplaced by amino acids with a shorter chain, such as aspartic acid (D) or glycine (G), these interactions could be significantly altered. Other substitutions of residue 119 may result in\naltered binding processes and NAI resistance in influenza A and B. A change to glycine (G) or alanine (A) or even valine (V) (nonpolar side chain) can remove both interactions, thus\nfurther destabilizing the inhibitor binding. E119 residue only plays a minor role in the binding of oseltamivir carboxylate to NA, because its location within the pocket 3 region, due to a\nsmall amino group in oseltamivir. The NA with E119V may accommodate a water molecule, which would interfere with the binding of oseltamivir to the active site.

Or increase the pore diameter, so that even if\nthe blocker binds, it will not block the channel. This observation can be the reason for the change in the H + fluxes, because the S31N mutation showed a decrease in current and the\nV27A showed an increase in the current of the protons. For both of the pore sites, the amino group of amantadine forms polar contacts with the hydroxyl group of S31. Thus, a mutation\nat S31 will dramatically decrease the effect of the drug. At pore site 3, the drug adamantly cage interacts with S31 and the drug amino group does not form any specific interactions.\nTherefore the S31N mutation can lead to steric hindrance due to a bulkier side chain of asparagine. This can substantially weaken the helix-helix packing. The mutant with S31N is more\nresistant to rimantadine than amantadine. This may be related to the fact that several drug-resistant mutation in M2 pore lining residues retain the ability to bind the drug and\nrimantadine my bind less well to the S31N protein than amantadine.

The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

The NA with E119V may accommodate a water molecule, which would interfere with the binding of\noseltamivir to the active site. Compared to the positively charged guanidine group in zanamivir, which contributes the most to the drug\u2019s overall binding. (144, 197, 208, 222, 257, 272)\nH274Y: The hydrophobic 3-pentyloxy group in oseltamivir induces a reposition of the E276 side chain to achieve optimal hydrophobic interactions and binds to the active pocket. The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

The mutation allows the binding of natural sialic acid substrate, so mutated virus can survive and propagate. Therefore, H274 mutation does not cause zanamivir resistance\nand is generally unaffected by conformational changes conferred by H274Y. The E276-R292 interaction is strengthened by the mutation, however this change occurred concurrently with\na weakening of the E277-R292 interaction and changes in hydrogen bonding between the zanamivir tail and R118, E276 and E277. The hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of\nthe trihydroxypropyl tail of zanamivir and E277 carboxyl group in WT were replaced with hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring E276 carboxyl in the mutant, as inferred from the\ndistance distributions for the oxygen atoms. The structure of the H274Y mutant and zanamivir showed a small shift in the side chain of E276, enabling the interaction between the\ninhibitor and E276 without the disruption observed in the sialic acid complexed with wild type NA.

H274Y blocks these side chain\nconformational changes and thus reduces the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The hydrophilic glycerol moiety in zanamivir interacts with E276 by hydrogen bonding in the same\nway as the natural substrate, so no conformational rearrangement is required and the mutation does not cause zanamivir resistance. Peramivir shares the similar hydrophobic\ninteraction with E276 as oseltamivir, so H274Y can also reduce peramivir sensitivity. Compensatory mutation, such as R221Q and V233M, residues outside the binding pocket may\ncontribute to resistance fitness. R221Q and V233M associated with H274Y significantly enhances the influenza virus infectivity and its ability to replicate in the host cells, likely due to the\nrestoration of the flexibility of E276 previously restricted by the H274Y mutation. D344N has been suggested to enhance NA substrate affinity when H274Y is present. It is located in the\nvicinity of the catalytic site of N1, which may influence the affinity of the NA for its substrate, whereas remote substitutions in the ectodomain are less likely to be significant.

        "mechanism": "N295S: The side chain of S294 in the mutant is oriented, so that its polar hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with carboxylate of E276. The side chain of N294 in the wild type is\ndirected approximately in the opposite direction, towards Y347. The loss of the asparagine side chain at position 294 enables the main chain carbonyl of Y347 to flip out from its position\nin the wild type so that it no longer coordinates to the bound calcium ion and it will interact with R292. The consequence is that there will be a less well-ordered conformation for the\nside chain of Y347 and a weaker hydrogen bond interaction with the carboxylate of oseltamivir and by inference with the equivalent carboxylate in zanamivir and sialic acid. The weaker\nbinding of this mutant to oseltamivir results from a combination of the effect on Y347 and the effect of the substituted serine residue hydrogen bonding to the side chain of E276. The\nhydrogen bond will stabilize the serine side chain conformation, so that the polar hydroxyl group is brought into what is otherwise a hydrophobic binding site for oseltamivir in wild type\nNA. This perturbation of the hydrophobic make-up of the binding site, is expected to affect the binding of oseltamivir, but not zanamivir. The changes involving S294 interactions suggest\nthat part of the weakening in the zanamivir binding is directly attributable to the mutated residue itself. The amino acid E276 has to rotate with R224 to form a pocket for the side chain\nof oseltamivir. So, the mutations R292K, N294S and H274Y inhibit this rotation and prevent the pocket from forming, resulting in the resistance to oseltamivir, but they allow the binding\nof natural sialic acid substrate. Thus, the virus can survive and propagate, but the binding of zanamivir, that doesn\u2019t need reorientation of amino acids, remains sensitive to the drug.

R292K, N294S and H274Y inhibits this rotation and prevents the pocket from forming,\nresulting in resistance to oseltamivir. The mutation still allows the binding of natural sialic acid substrate, so the virus can propagate and survive. The loss of a H-bond from R292 to the\ncarboxylate of oseltamivir is complemented by a H-bond from Y344, helping to abrogate loss of drug susceptibility. The Y347 forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of\noseltamivir and compensates for the loss of the link with the R292, which explains why the R292K mutation does not confer oseltamivir resistance. No reorientation is needed for the\nbinding of zanamivir, so these mutated viruses remains sensitive to zanamivir. R292K has a smaller effect on group 1 NA. The conserved tyrosine residue at position 347 in group 1 NA\nmakes an additional hydrogen bond to the carboxylate group of the inhibitor, that cannot be made by the equivalent residues in group 2 NA. This way, it seems that the additional\nhydrogen bond interaction between Y347and the carboxylate of the inhibitor compensate for a weaker-water-mediated interaction between the carboxylate and the substituted lysine\nresidue at position 292.

This perturbation of the hydrophobic make-up of the binding site, is expected to affect the binding of oseltamivir, but not zanamivir. The changes involving S294 interactions suggest\nthat part of the weakening in the zanamivir binding is directly attributable to the mutated residue itself. The amino acid E276 has to rotate with R224 to form a pocket for the side chain\nof oseltamivir. So, the mutations R292K, N294S and H274Y inhibit this rotation and prevent the pocket from forming, resulting in the resistance to oseltamivir, but they allow the binding\nof natural sialic acid substrate. Thus, the virus can survive and propagate, but the binding of zanamivir, that doesn\u2019t need reorientation of amino acids, remains sensitive to the drug. (48,\n49, 50, 104, 156, 172, 216, 272)",

The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).\nI222M + H274Y: H274Y has no impact on the zanamivir susceptibility, but causes high-level oseltamivir resistance. The additional mutations I222M or I222V involve the other ethyl\nmoiety of the oseltamivir diethyl extension and results in the loss of hydrophobic interaction between the side chain of I222 and oseltamivir. It will further destabilize and change the\nprotein fold around R224 affecting the drug binding pocket. In case of I222M, the longer amino acid chain of methionine partially projects into the binding site. However, the\ncombination with H274Y results in an extensive occlusion of the active site, so that it can no longer accommodate the bulky diethyl extension of oseltamivir (112, 156, 157)",

It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

R224 is important in the formation of a salt\nlink to E276, that is involved in the formation of the hydrophobic pocket for oseltamivir binding. If a mutation occurs at I222, this would lead to the loss of interactions between the side\nchain of I222 and the pentyl ether group of oseltamivir. Therefore, there will be a greater impact on the binding of oseltamivir than of zanamivir. The mutation I222M potentially causes\na steric clash with R152. It will possibly push it away from oseltamivir and cause the loss of a hydrogen bond that this arginine makes with oseltamivir. The I222M mutation will only have\na small impact on the peramivir binding, that also needs reorientation of E276 to form the hydrophobic pocket to accommodate its side chain. The lack of effect can be due to the\nadditional strong interactions of the 4-guanidinium group of peramivir. (156, 157, 158, 243)\nH274Y: The hydrophobic 3-pentyloxy group in oseltamivir induces a reposition of the Glu276 side chain to achieve optimal hydrophobic interactions and binds to the active pocket. The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. As peramivir shares a similar 3\u2019-diethyl moiety as oseltamivir, it has a\nsimilar hydrophobic interaction with Glu276 as oseltamivir, so H274 mutation may also reduce peramivir sensitivity. However, the 5\u2019 functionality of peramivir allows hydrogen bonds to\nresidues R156 and W180 as a result of the mutation. This may account for the partial retainment of activity.

R224 is important in the formation of a salt link\nto E276, that is involved in the formation of the hydrophobic pocket for oseltamivir binding. If a mutation occurs at I222, this would lead to the loss of interactions between the side\nchain of I222 and the pentyl ether group of oseltamivir. Therefore, there will be a greater impact on the binding of oseltamivir than of zanamivir. I222R and I222K will narrow the NA\nactive site pocket, thus causing steric clashes. The active site pocket accommodates the hydrophobic pentoxyl group of oseltamivir. These changes most likely result in active site\nendpoint interactions affection the drug binding affinity and it could disturb the proposed electrostatic binding funnel, instrumental in direction NAIs into and out of the binding sites on\nNA. The extended side chain of an arginine would come very close to the hydrophobic moiety of oseltamivir or peramivir, thus disrupting their binding to the NA enzyme. For zanamivir,\nthe corresponding glycerol moiety sits slightly higher up in the binding site and is less impacted by the mutation. In addition, any disruption of binding may be offset by potential\nhydrogen bonds between the glycerol hydroxyls and the nitrogens in the arginine side chain. (10, 69, 90, 156, 157, 207)\nH274Y: The hydrophilic 3\u2019-glycerol moiety in zanamivir interacts with E276 through hydrogen bonding in the same way as the natural substrate SA, no conformational rearrangement is\nrequired. The mutation allows the binding of natural sialic acid substrate, so mutated virus can survive and propagate. Therefore, H274 mutation does not cause zanamivir resistance\nand is generally unaffected by conformational changes conferred by H274Y. The E276-R292 interaction is strengthened by the mutation, however this change occurred concurrently with\na weakening of the E277-R292 interaction and changes in hydrogen bonding between the zanamivir tail and R118, E276 and E277. The hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of\nthe trihydroxypropyl tail of zanamivir and E277 carboxyl group in WT were replaced with hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring E276 carboxyl in the mutant, as inferred from the\ndistance distributions for the oxygen atoms. The structure of the H274Y mutant and zanamivir showed a small shift in the side chain of E276, enabling the interaction between the\ninhibitor and E276 without the disruption observed in the sialic acid complexed with wild type NA. A mutation at position 274 has only an impact on the oseltamivir sensitivity in group 1\n(N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). (15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245)",

The terminal group of R152 translates much closer to the hydrophobic pentoxyl group of oseltamivir. A double mutation of I222K and H274Y perturbs the side chain of R152 by\nthe smaller threonine (T) and of E276 by the bulkier tyrosine (Y), resulting in the shrinkage at the edge of the active pocket in two opposite direction.

(156, 207)\nN295S: The side chain of S294 in the mutant is oriented, so that its polar hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with carboxylate of E276. The side chain of N294 in the wild type is\ndirected approximately in the opposite direction, towards Y347. The loss of the asparagine side chain at position 294 enables the main chain carbonyl of Y347 to flip out from its position\nin the wild type so that it no longer coordinates to the bound calcium ion and it will interact with R292. The consequence is that there will be a less well-ordered conformation for the\nside chain of Y347 and a weaker hydrogen bond interaction with the carboxylate of oseltamivir and by inference with the equivalent carboxylate in zanamivir and sialic acid. The weaker\nbinding of this mutant to oseltamivir results from a combination of the effect on Y347 and the effect of the substituted serine residue hydrogen bonding to the side chain of E276. The\nhydrogen bond will stabilize the serine side chain conformation, so that the polar hydroxyl group is brought into what is otherwise a hydrophobic binding site for oseltamivir in wild type\nNA. This perturbation of the hydrophobic make-up of the binding site, is expected to affect the binding of oseltamivir, but not zanamivir. The changes involving S294 interactions suggest\nthat part of the weakening in the zanamivir binding is directly attributable to the mutated residue itself. The amino acid E276 has to rotate with R224 to form a pocket for the side chain\nof oseltamivir. So, the mutations R292K, N294S and H274Y inhibit this rotation and prevent the pocket from forming, resulting in the resistance to oseltamivir, but they allow the binding\nof natural sialic acid substrate. Thus, the virus can survive and propagate, but the binding of zanamivir, that doesn\u2019t need reorientation of amino acids, remains sensitive to the drug. (48,\n49, 50, 104, 156, 172, 216, 272)\nH274Y: The hydrophobic 3-pentyloxy group in oseltamivir induces a reposition of the E276 side chain to achieve optimal hydrophobic interactions and binds to the active pocket. The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

If a mutation occurs at I222, this would lead to the loss of interactions between the side\nchain of I222 and the pentyl ether group of oseltamivir. Therefore, there will be a greater impact on the binding of oseltamivir than of zanamivir. The I222V mutation reduces the\nhydrophobicity of the active site, hence decreasing the favourable interactions with oseltamivir. Oseltamivir will probably still bind in its standard way, so the I222V mutation will cause a\nless pronounced effect than I222R. The effect on zanamivir is not significant. (156, 207)\nN295S: The side chain of S294 in the mutant is oriented, so that its polar hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with carboxylate of E276. The side chain of N294 in the wild type is\ndirected approximately in the opposite direction, towards Y347. The loss of the asparagine side chain at position 294 enables the main chain carbonyl of Y347 to flip out from its position\nin the wild type so that it no longer coordinates to the bound calcium ion and it will interact with R292. The consequence is that there will be a less well-ordered conformation for the\nside chain of Y347 and a weaker hydrogen bond interaction with the carboxylate of oseltamivir and by inference with the equivalent carboxylate in zanamivir and sialic acid. The weaker\nbinding of this mutant to oseltamivir results from a combination of the effect on Y347 and the effect of the substituted serine residue hydrogen bonding to the side chain of E276. The\nhydrogen bond will stabilize the serine side chain conformation, so that the polar hydroxyl group is brought into what is otherwise a hydrophobic binding site for oseltamivir in wild type\nNA. This perturbation of the hydrophobic make-up of the binding site, is expected to affect the binding of oseltamivir, but not zanamivir.

The mutation allows the binding of natural sialic acid substrate, so mutated virus can survive and propagate. Therefore, H274 mutation does not cause zanamivir resistance\nand is generally unaffected by conformational changes conferred by H274Y. The E276-R292 interaction is strengthened by the mutation, however this change occurred concurrently with\na weakening of the E277-R292 interaction and changes in hydrogen bonding between the zanamivir tail and R118, E276 and E277. The hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of\nthe trihydroxypropyl tail of zanamivir and E277 carboxyl group in WT were replaced with hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring E276 carboxyl in the mutant, as inferred from the\ndistance distributions for the oxygen atoms. The structure of the H274Y mutant and zanamivir showed a small shift in the side chain of E276, enabling the interaction between the\ninhibitor and E276 without the disruption observed in the sialic acid complexed with wild type NA. A mutation at position 274 has only an impact on the oseltamivir sensitivity in group 1\n(N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). (15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245)",

(137)\nH274Y: The hydrophobic 3-pentyloxy group in oseltamivir induces a reposition of the E276 side chain to achieve optimal hydrophobic interactions and binds to the active pocket. The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

However, this region of the NA is in the stalk and not part\nof the globular domain and is not known how it would affect NA structure and stability. (119)\nH274Y: The hydrophobic 3-pentyloxy group in oseltamivir induces a reposition of the E276 side chain to achieve optimal hydrophobic interactions and binds to the active pocket. The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

Peramivir will also be affected by\nthe mutation, since it has the same guanidine moiety as zanamivir. Q136K introduces repulsive charges to the guanidine group of both zanamivir and peramivir. In contrast, oseltamivir\ndoes not form interactions with R156 or the D151 backbone and are unaffected by the mutation, because it lacks a functional group approaching lysine at position 136. Q136K mutants\nremain susceptible to oseltamivir, so the interactions between the D151 side chain and oseltamivir are probably maintained. (10, 69, 94, 113, 114, 223, 243)",

This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir.

The Q136K mutation can break down the hydrogen bonding network, possibly leading to increased mobility of the R156 and D151\nresidues, which disturbed the interactions between these residues and zanamivir, which leads to an increase in resistance. The cause of zanamivir drug resistance due to Q136K can be\nascribed to the fact that the mutated K136 deforms the 150 loop, which then weakens the interaction between zanamivir and the active site residues. Peramivir will also be affected by\nthe mutation, since it has the same guanidine moiety as zanamivir. Q136K introduces repulsive charges to the guanidine group of both zanamivir and peramivir. In contrast, oseltamivir\ndoes not form interactions with R156 or the D151 backbone and are unaffected by the mutation, because it lacks a functional group approaching lysine at position 136. Q136K mutants\nremain susceptible to oseltamivir, so the interactions between the D151 side chain and oseltamivir are probably maintained. (10, 69, 94, 113, 114, 223, 243)\nH274Y: The hydrophobic 3-pentyloxy group in oseltamivir induces a reposition of the E276 side chain to achieve optimal hydrophobic interactions and binds to the active pocket. The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

The principal role of D151 is to stabilize the transition-\nstate intermediate in the cleavage reaction. However, G151 has similar activities as D151 enzymes, this indicates that aspartic acid is not essential for catalysis. Aspartic acid does have an\nimportant role in restricting the binding specificity of NA to match its cleavage activity and the complementary binding specificities of HA.

Peramivir will also be affected by\nthe mutation, since it has the same guanidine moiety as zanamivir. Q136K introduces repulsive charges to the guanidine group of both zanamivir and peramivir. In contrast, oseltamivir\ndoes not form interactions with R156 or the D151 backbone and are unaffected by the mutation, because it lacks a functional group approaching lysine at position 136. Q136K mutants\nremain susceptible to oseltamivir, so the interactions between the D151 side chain and oseltamivir are probably maintained.

D151 forms 2\nhydrogen bonds with the guanidine moiety of zanamivir. R156 also interacts directly with zanamivir via van der Waals interactions. Group 1 NA (N1, N4, N5 and N8) has a 150-loop\n(residue 147-152) conformation, that opens up a cavity adjacent to the active site, the 150-cavity, which is not present in group 2 NA.

        "mechanism": "E276 must rotate and bind with R224 to form a pocket for the side chain of oseltamivir. R292K, N294S and H274Y inhibits this rotation and prevents the pocket from forming, resulting in\nresistance to oseltamivir. The mutation still allows the binding of natural sialic acid substrate, so the virus can propagate and survive. The loss of a H-bond from R292 to the carboxylate\nof oseltamivir is complemented by a H-bond from Y344, helping to abrogate loss of drug susceptibility. The Y347 forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of oseltamivir and\ncompensates for the loss of the link with the R292, which explains why the R292K mutation does not confer oseltamivir resistance. No reorientation is needed for the binding of\nzanamivir, so these mutated viruses remains sensitive to zanamivir. R292K has a smaller effect on group 1 NA. The conserved tyrosine residue at position 347 in group 1 NA makes an\nadditional hydrogen bond to the carboxylate group of the inhibitor, that cannot be made by the equivalent residues in group 2 NA. This way, it seems that the additional hydrogen bond\ninteraction between Y347and the carboxylate of the inhibitor compensate for a weaker-water-mediated interaction between the carboxylate and the substituted lysine residue at\nposition 292.

If H274Y is present, E277 will be pushed further into the drug binding\npocket, which will weaken the oseltamivir binding. (32, 115)\nH274Y: The hydrophobic 3-pentyloxy group in oseltamivir induces a reposition of the E276 side chain to achieve optimal hydrophobic interactions and binds to the active pocket. The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

H274Y blocks these side chain\nconformational changes and thus reduces the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The hydrophilic glycerol moiety in zanamivir interacts with E276 by hydrogen bonding in the same\nway as the natural substrate, so no conformational rearrangement is required and the mutation does not cause zanamivir resistance. Peramivir shares the similar hydrophobic\ninteraction with E276 as oseltamivir, so H274Y can also reduce peramivir sensitivity. Compensatory mutation, such as R221Q and V233M, residues outside the binding pocket may\ncontribute to resistance fitness. R221Q and V233M associated with H274Y significantly enhances the influenza virus infectivity and its ability to replicate in the host cells, likely due to the\nrestoration of the flexibility of E276 previously restricted by the H274Y mutation. The substitution of a charged (R) by an uncharged (Q) amino acid at codon 221 may be the main\nchange, that dramatically altered the NA enzyme properties. V234M decreased the magnitude of the defect caused by H274Y. It increases the amount of NA that reaches the cell surface.\n(6, 7, 29, 82, 91, 230)\nH274Y: The hydrophobic 3-pentyloxy group in oseltamivir induces a reposition of the E276 side chain to achieve optimal hydrophobic interactions and binds to the active pocket. The\nsubstituted tyrosine residue disturbs the lodging of the hydrophobic side chain of oseltamivir in the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site and causes a conformational change in\nthe inhibitor moving from the NA-bound position and thus reducing the drug binding efficiency of oseltamivir. The mutation H274Y shifts the E276 conformation closer to R292 and the\ncarboxyl group of the inhibitor. The E277-R292 distance distribution remained largely unchanges, but the subtle conformational changes among charged residues may disrupt the\noseltamivir binding. This only happens in group 1 (N1, N4, N5 & N8), but not for group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9). It has not been detected in N2 neuraminidases from community isolates\nand when experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and generated by reverse genetics, the mutation had no impact on oseltamivir sensitivity. This is because residue 246 is a\nserine residue in N1 neuraminidase and an alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase. Therefore, although the mutation sterically clashes with one diethyl moiety of oseltamivir, the\nadditional space and hydrophobic nature of the alanine residue in N2 neuraminidase allows favourable interactions to form with the other diethyl moiety of oseltamivir. The binding\naffinity of oseltamivir carboxylate to N1 NA is determined by the side chain volume of amino acid residue at position 274 and not by the capability of the hydrogen bonding formation.\n(10, 15, 112, 172, 216, 230, 245, 271).",

BM2 proton conductance has a pH profile similar to that of AM2. There are, however, significant differences between\nthe two channels. The two protein share almost no sequence homology except for the HXXXW sequence motif in the TM domain. Their domain sizes are also different. The N-terminal\nunstructured segment preceding the TM domain of BM2 is very short (residues 1-4), whereas its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain is no longer than that of AM2 by about 27 residues. BM2\nchannel activity is higher than that of AM2 and unlike AM2, the BM2 proton conductance is completely insensitive to amantadine and rimantadine. (203)",

For both of the pore sites, the amino group of amantadine forms polar contacts with the hydroxyl group of S31. Thus, a mutation\nat S31 will dramatically decrease the effect of the drug. At pore site 3, the drug adamantly cage interacts with S31 and the drug amino group does not form any specific interactions.\nTherefore the S31N mutation can lead to steric hindrance due to a bulkier side chain of asparagine. This can substantially weaken the helix-helix packing. The mutant with S31N is more\nresistant to rimantadine than amantadine. This may be related to the fact that several drug-resistant mutation in M2 pore lining residues retain the ability to bind the drug and\nrimantadine my bind less well to the S31N protein than amantadine.

This observation can be the reason for the change in the H + fluxes, because the S31N mutation showed a decrease in current and the V27A showed an increase in the current\nof the protons. At pore site 1, the hydrophobic cage of amantadine interacts with the V27 side chains and the amino group with the hydroxyl group of S31. The V27A mutation can\nweaken the binding at this position by decreasing hydrophobic contacts. Replacing V27 with smaller alanines, would in principle widen the channel entrance and would thus facilitate\nrather than resist the drug binding and inhibition. The overall structure of the bundle is not perturbed by the mutation V27A. Therefore, the effect of the mutation can be rationalized by\nobserving that replacing the bulky valine side chain with the smaller alanine methyl moiety, results in an expansion of the pore radius near the top of the amantadine binding site. The\nV27 methyls provide a substantial amount of inter-helical van der Waals interactions that contribute to channel assembly. These interactions result in the formation of a tight\nhydrophobic ring that constricts the N-terminal channel opening. In the V27A structure, the side chain of alanine is too small to form strong interhelical packing, which may cause the\nweakened tetrameric assembly.
